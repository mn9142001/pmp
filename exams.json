  "Answer3": "C-) A spending plan can be used as a cost baseline to measure payments.",
  "Answer4": "D-) At a given moment, PMB provides the physical work that should have been accomplished.",
  "Correct-Answer": "Answer b.",
  "Explanation": "  Total Earned Value is not a performance measurement baseline. The variables that help measure the performance on the project are Planned Value, Earned Value and Actual Cost. Planned Value (PV) is the authorized budget assigned to scheduled work. It is the authorized budget planned for the work to be accomplished for an activity or work breakdown structure component, not including management reserve. This budget is allocated by phase over the life of the project, but at a given moment, planned value defines the physical work that should have been accomplished. The total of the PV is sometimes referred to as the performance measurement baseline (PMB). The total planned value for the project is also known as the budget at completion (BAC).

  "Answer1": "A-) The most experienced architect resigned, which had not been anticipated earlier.",
  "Answer2": "B-) Cost of labor increased due to annual salary increase",

  "Correct-Answer": "Answer c.",
  "Explanation": "  Answer C is correct. The project is ahead of schedule (SPI>1) and above budget (CPI<1). Crashing is a technique used to shorten the schedule duration for the least incremental cost by adding resources. Examples of crashing include approving overtime, bringing additional resources, or paying to activities on the critical path. Answer C is correct. The project is ahead of schedule (SPI>1) and above budget (CPI<1). Crashing is a technique used to shorten the schedule duration for the least incremental cost by adding resources. Examples of crashing include approving overtime, bringing additional resources, or paying to activities on the critical path. We don’t have any indication in the scenario that the lead architect resigned, and the project performance indicates that there are no schedule delays (Answer A). On the contrary, SPI is 1.21 which means that the project is 21% ahead of schedule.  The increase of salaries will not put the project over budget, and the annual increases are usually planned in the budget (Answer B). If Lara released team members, then the schedule would have suffered, so Answer D is not correct either.

  "Answer2": "Stakeholder Engagement Assessment Matrix",
  "Answer3": "Stakeholder Register",
  "Answer4": "Communication Management Plan",
  "Correct-Answer": "Answer a.",
  "Explanation": "  Answer a. Stakeholder Management Plan: Arriving at the correct answer to this question is a good example of how the process of elimination can be used effectively. First, focus on the words in the problem that might strike you as key: “detailed plans,” “manage stakeholders,” and “their expectations.” You should know that answer option b., “Stakeholder Engagement Assessment Matrix,” is used to identify the engagement levels of stakeholders – and it is a Tool\/Technique, not a document. Option c., “Stakeholder Register,” is a document – but it is all about identifying stakeholders and their characteristics. And option d., “Communications Management Plan,” is certainly not “composed primarily of detailed plans as to how the Project Manager might manage stakeholders and their expectations.” The only viable answer option is a., Stakeholder Management Plan."

Resolving 20% of the identified issues can resolve 80% of the identified problems. Ishikawa’s fishbone chart helps identify the issues but does not focus on the frequency of occurrence. Control Charts evidence the number or magnitude of the deviations over time, but not the cause. Flowcharts are process maps that define the sequence of steps and branching possibilities that exist for a process."

  "Question": "#119. A new project manager needs to deliver a strategic agile project. The vendor working with the team is in another country. Though this vendor has delivered excellent quality work on time in the past, they are currently behind schedule. The team explains to the project manager that their attempts to get the vendor back on schedule have failed. They have sent emails and phoned, but the vendor only gives vague, noncommittal responses. The project sponsor insists that this vendor is essential to the success of the project and an important partner of the business. Which action should the project manager take?",
  "Answer1": "Contact the vendor and be direct about the consequences of their actions and delays.",
  "Answer2": "Create a virtual workspace for the team so that everyone is aware of and accountable for their tasks and aware of due dates. Include the project sponsor.",

  "Answer4": "Ask the project sponsor to use personal influence to get the vendor back on schedule.",
  "Correct-Answer": "Answer b.",
  "Explanation": "  Answer b. Communication in virtual teams can be challenging. Being direct may NOT leave a good first impression and revising a service agreement may be perceived as hostile by the vendor. This vendor is critical to the success of the project and important to the business, and the team may be getting demoralized by their unsuccessful attempts to manage the vendor. Be attentive of these factors using active listening and emotional intelligence. Creating a workspace that enables everyone on the project team to see the project work and be accountable for delivering their work on time is the best option here. Including the project sponsor in the virtual workspace as an informed party is a smart move."

  "Answer1": "The project is behind schedule and over budget.",
  "Answer2": "The project is ahead of schedule and under budget.",
  "Answer3": "The project is ahead of schedule and over budget",
  "Answer4": "The project is behind schedule and under budget.",
  "Correct-Answer": "Answer d.",
  "Explanation": "  Answer d. The project is behind schedule and under budget: This question confirms the student’s understanding of two important Earned Value Measurements, Cost Performance Index (CPI), and Schedule Performance Index (SPI). The calculation of the former is CPI = EV (Earned Value)\/AC (Actual Costs); and of the latter, SPI = EV\/PV (Planned Value). In this problem, the CPI is 1.33. As you learned in class, any CPI result over 1.0 is a desirable result as it indicates the project is under budget. The SPI is 0.8. Also, as you learned in class, any SPI result under 1.0 is not good because it indicates the project is behind schedule. Answer option d., therefore, is the correct answer: “The project is behind schedule and under budget.”"

What does this mean?",
  "Answer1": "The team still needs to do refactoring and user testing.",

An iteration is “approved” when the product owner is satisfied that the product increment meets the iteration goal–the items selected from the backlog for that iteration. Although the customer might also think of another feature to add to the backlog, they would still approve the iteration if the work that was done meets the goal that was set. The other two options (missing refactoring, QA testing) are activities that should have been done during the iteration. If the team hasn’t done them, that might be a reason for not approving the iteration. But they aren’t the best answer to this scenario, since we don’t have enough information to pick one of them.

  "Answer2": "Facilitate a meeting between the Product Owner and the Development Team to discuss any corrective actions that can be taken.",
  "Answer3": "Ask the Development Team to increase velocity to meet the project completion date.",
  "Answer4": "Ask the sponsor to remove features from the Product backlog, then re-plan remaining sprints.",
  "Correct-Answer": "Answer b.",
  "Explanation": " Answer b. In Agile frameworks, the Agile Project Manager’s goal is to remove obstacles that get in the way of completing the functionality that the team committed to in each Sprint(iteration). The best thing for the project manager to do is facilitate a meeting to discuss the best go-forward approach. The burndown chart is the first indicator that the iteration is either on or off track, and if the team recognizes that it overcommitted to the sprint, it will discuss this with the Product Owner to determine which low-priority feature should be dropped from the Sprint. Option A is incorrect, as crashing is used in traditional project management to get the project back on track. Answer b.

  "Answer1": "Refactoring is a process in which the development team cleans up the code now to save time that may be needed to upgrade it later.",
  "Answer2": "Refactoring is a process in which the development team enters a new code to deliver a relatively similar product in functionality but much better.",
  "Answer3": "Refactoring is a process in which the development team retests the product among a new set of users and collects different feedback.",
  "Answer4": "Refactoring is a process in which the development team re-codes the code to produce better elements within the product.",

Think of it in 4 steps.   Step 1: Perform SPI: SPI = EV\/PV. In this problem, we know the SPI (0.8), and we know the PV (10 miles of a petroleum pipeline to be completed). The unknown is the EV. Therefore, 0.8 = ? \/ 10 miles. Playing easily with numbers, you should get: 0.8 = 8 \/ 10. Step 1: Perform SPI: SPI = EV\/PV. In this problem, we know the SPI (0.8), and we know the PV (10 miles of a petroleum pipeline to be completed). The unknown is the EV. Therefore, 0.8 = ? \/ 10 miles. Playing easily with numbers, you should get: 0.8 = 8 \/ 10.   Step 2: Determine the miles of pipeline that remain to be completed. You do this by subtracting the EV (8) from the PV (10): 10 – 8 = 2 miles of pipeline that remain to be completed. Step 2: Determine the miles of pipeline that remain to be completed. You do this by subtracting the EV (8) from the PV (10): 10 – 8 = 2 miles of pipeline that remain to be completed.   Step 3: Now, you can determine the percentage of pipeline miles completed per week by dividing the pipeline miles completed by the weeks needed to complete 1 mile of the pipeline: 8 \/ 20 = 0.4.
